I was also a part of the mentorship program for new joiners in the American Express office During my undergraduate studies, my Java teacher gave me an opportunity to conduct a seminar named �IOStream� on Java File Handling to a class of 40 students. I also conducted a workshop to learn Git and GitHub as part of Google Developers Group Club at my college and a huge number of students attended the workshop. I supported NGOs with early childhood education programs in the area of Mathematics during my undergraduation. I also prepared lesson plans, learning outcomes measured students progress and took the maths classes weekly 3 hours for a year. I have a unique ability to see where students require assistance, allowing me to reteach the concepts in a way that the students can understand.  I believe that working as a teacher's assistant will supplement my student teaching experience.

Smith71,Joe71,Smith71,,"Statistics and mathematics is my area of expertise. I have been extremely interested in the field of Mathematics for many years and as an undergraduate student. I have taken 67 credit hours of Mathematics and Statistics courses, and 19 credit hours of computer science courses. Aside from the courses required for graduation, I enrolled in classes that interested me such as Mathematical Statistics, Number Theory, and Artificial Intelligence in which I excelled as a student. I had a major GPA of 3.8.   As an undergraduate student, I tutored numerous mathematics courses both online and in-person to 4 undergraduate students for two years. These courses included Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, Machine Learning, and the mathematics section of the GRE. I enjoy explaining abstract concepts at each student�s level of understanding. My students have reported that they find my explanations clear and valuable for their learning which helped them receive high grades. Although teaching students online was challenging because of the technical difficulties, I was able to overcome them using my tablet device that simulated a real classroom environment.   While I was serving in the Korean Army, I helped numerous squadrons study and learn English free of charge. I held separate group study sessions for students of varying language skills and helped them improve their grammar and conversational skills. Many of these students were disadvantaged and their improved English proficiency exam scores helped them transfer to a more prestigious school.    In addition to the highly technical skills learned from computer science courses, I have a vast experience in data analysis. I have worked on multiple machine-learning projects that involved natural language and image processing. These projects were mostly executed in Python. I will elaborate on my specific computer science qualification in the following section.","I modeled and trained GNNs to identify ADHD patients from EEG recordings and compared them with existing CNN models. Raw EEG recordings were preprocessed using MATLAB (EEGLAB) and my GNN models obtained 98.65% accuracy. I am currently working on explainable AI and further analysis.  I performed a sentiment analysis on Twitter and Parler users� reactions to the 2020 U.S. Capitol incident. Twitter API was utilized to collect the data, and I created a preprocessing pipeline using bash and Python script on a Linux server. Over 10GB of textual data was analyzed.  After taking an online course on artificial intelligence, I built a deep neural network classifier using softmax regression from scratch. I trained this model on a well-known MNIST digit dataset and obtained 96% accuracy. This work was done and published on Kaggle.   Using bash script, I was able to automate data download and preprocessing. The downloaded data was uploaded to the PostgreSQL server, where I connected and used google data studios to create updated data reports automatically.  I am currently using macOS, but I am very familiar with Windows and Linux operating systems.",CourseTitleInstructorPositionWhenSTAT�8Introduction to BiostatisticsBrigitte BaldiTA2023-spring,CourseTitleGrWhenSTATS�280SEMINAR IN STATSS202303STATS�255STAT METH SURVIVALB+202303STATS�211STATS METHOD IIB+202303STATS�200BINT PROB & STAT THYB+202303STATS�280SEMINAR IN STATSS202292STATS�210STATS METHODS IA202292STATS�200AINT PROB & STAT THYB+202292CS�284AAI IN BIO AND MEDA202292

Smith109,Joe109,Smith109,Computer Science,"I consider my area of expertise is in software development and machine learning. I am also well-equipped in the web application development space. Through professional experiences and personal projects, I am constantly learning about new and interesting tools and technologies related to this intersection, with a special passion and focus on healthcare technologies. My strengths include proficiency in languages such as Python and C/C++. I have worked with these languages enough to be well-versed with their nuances, and I have a strong grasp on data structures and algorithms as well. Through multiple data-related courses and projects, SQL is another skill I've built upon. I am competent in multiple frameworks such as PostgreSQL, MySQL and NoSQL. Of course, the application and use of data in machine learning is one of my focus areas. During my undergraduate degree, I was a subject matter expert (SME) in the Machine Learning club, where I led workshops and delivered seminars to classes of 40+ students, a couple of them being held remotely. With experience in multiple sister domains such as NLP, Computer Vision and Reinforcement Learning, I believe I offer a diverse skill set. As a teaching assistant in the C++ programming course during my Bachelor's, I regularly helped students with doubts and clarifications. I often created documents with useful resources to aid the learning of concepts too. Additionally, I communicate ideas well in a written format, which I think could be a useful skill as well. Sharing what I've learnt in a concise and helpful manner is an ability I've built over the years, not just through formal teaching experiences, but through the natural process of helping my peers. I am excited by the opportunity to aid the learning of other students.","As mentioned above, I have a strong grasp on C/C++ and SQL, through formal coursework and practical applications. I have built on my skills in C/C++ since high school, and I have worked with SQL regularly for various projects since the very first year of my undergraduate program, so I believe I am well-versed in the fundamentals of these languages. My experience in multiple database management systems such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite and NoSQL (MongoDB) would hold me in good stead as well. I do have some experience with Java programming too, though I have not used it regularly. However, if necessary, I could definitely pick it up again.  Operating systems that I am experienced in include Windows and Linux (Ubuntu). I have carried out quite a bit of my development work on Linux environments successfully, so working with the command line is quite natural. Of course, Windows has been my everyday operating system of choice and I understand both of these operating systems well.
