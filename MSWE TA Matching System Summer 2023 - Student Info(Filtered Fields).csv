I have taken 67 credit hours of Mathematics and Statistics courses, and 19 credit hours of computer science courses. Aside from the courses required for graduation, I enrolled in classes that interested me such as Mathematical Statistics, Number Theory, and Artificial Intelligence in which I excelled as a student. I had a major GPA of 3.8.   As an undergraduate student, I tutored numerous mathematics courses both online and in-person to 4 undergraduate students for two years. These courses included Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, Machine Learning, and the mathematics section of the GRE. I enjoy explaining abstract concepts at each student’s level of understanding. My students have reported that they find my explanations clear and valuable for their learning which helped them receive high grades. Although teaching students online was challenging because of the technical difficulties, I was able to overcome them using my tablet device that simulated a real classroom environment.   While I was serving in the Korean Army, I helped numerous squadrons study and learn English free of charge. I held separate group study sessions for students of varying language skills and helped them improve their grammar and conversational skills. Many of these students were disadvantaged and their improved English proficiency exam scores helped them transfer to a more prestigious school.    In addition to the highly technical skills learned from computer science courses, I have a vast experience in data analysis. I have worked on multiple machine-learning projects that involved natural language and image processing. These projects were mostly executed in Python. I will elaborate on my specific computer science qualification in the following section.","I modeled and trained GNNs to identify ADHD patients from EEG recordings and compared them with existing CNN models. Raw EEG recordings were preprocessed using MATLAB (EEGLAB) and my GNN models obtained 98.65% accuracy. I am currently working on explainable AI and further analysis.  I performed a sentiment analysis on Twitter and Parler users’ reactions to the 2020 U.S. Capitol incident. Twitter API was utilized to collect the data, and I created a preprocessing pipeline using bash and Python script on a Linux server. Over 10GB of textual data was analyzed.  After taking an online course on artificial intelligence, I built a deep neural network classifier using softmax regression from scratch. I trained this model on a well-known MNIST digit dataset and obtained 96% accuracy. This work was done and published on Kaggle.   Using bash script, I was able to automate data download and preprocessing.
