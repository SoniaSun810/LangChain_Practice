My experience as a teaching assistant has given me valuable experience in designing and delivering online courses.\\nProgramming: I have a strong knowledge of Java as I took a course in object-oriented programming during my undergraduate studies, where I learned Java from basics to advanced concepts. I have also worked on multiple projects, including a learning management system and an online vacation planner, which involved using Java for web development and backend development.  For C/C++, I have been using them for around 6 years since high school and during my master's program. It is my primary programming language for competitive programming, and I have taken courses in my undergrad, including Operating Systems, Data Structures and Algorithms, and Computer Networks, where I used C/C++. I have also worked on course projects that involve C and C++.  I have extensive experience with Python, and it is the language where I have written the most lines of code. I have used it for multiple courses in my undergraduate and master's programs, and I mostly use it for my applied ML and deep learning research. I am also proficient in ML and DL libraries and frameworks such as PyTorch, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow.  Regarding SQL/Databases, I am extremely confident in my SQL knowledge and have been using it since high school. I am proficient in MySQL, PostgreSQL, and NoSQL databases such as MongoDB and AsterixDB. I also took a course in Databases and Database Management during my first quarter, which helped me refresh my knowledge of relational databases and become more confident in SQL. I have also used the above-mentioned projects in course projects during my undergraduate studies.  Finally, I have a highly proficient knowledge of Linux and took a course in Unix and shell programming during my undergraduate studies, where I gained an in-depth understanding of the Linux OS and different Linux commands. I have also been using Windows and macOS for several years, giving me a thorough knowledge of these operating systems as well.\\nPast Experience: \\nCourses Taken: CourseTitleGrWhenCS�295PKEYSTONE PROJ CSA+202303CS�273PMACH LRN & DATA MINA+202303CS�261PDATA STRUCTURESA202303CS�253PADV PROG PROB SOLVA+202292CS�238POPERATING SYSTEMSA202292CS�220PDATABAS & DATA MGMTA202292\", metadata={}), Document(page_content='Last Name: Smith64\\nFirst Name: Joe64\\nUci Net: Smith64\\nConcentration: Computer Science\\nArea of Expertise: I consider Machine Learning to be my area of expertise in Computer Science.

      "Area of Expertise: 1 I was a Teaching Assistant for the Department of Physics at UC Irvine for two quarters, i.e. Fall 2022 & Winter 2023. I worked under Professors Lee, Guerra, and Wu for classes Physics 3A, 3B, and 7C. My responsibilities included conducting discussions for 100+ students each quarter, conducting and grading quizzes as well as grading midterms and final exams.  2) This is my third quarter of graduate studies in ICS and I have maintained a consistent 4.0 GPA even after pursuing complicated courses like CS231P, CS253P, CS261P, CS271P, and CS273P. 3) I was a Teaching Assistant for my undergraduate course 'CSL802- Distributed Computing Lab' where I was responsible for creating a list of experiments that students would perform for the duration of the course. I also assisted students through various phases of their course projects. 4) During my role as a Data Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services, I was presented with a Colleague Appreciation Award for co-creating a month-long training program on \"Using SQL & Python to create efficient Azure data workflows in an Apache Spark-enabled distributed environment\" for newer associates across the organization. 5) During my undergraduate degree, I was among the 200 students across Asia-Pacific chosen by Intel Corporation as their Student Ambassadors for Artificial Intelligence (AI) for 2020. I was picked after three rigorous rounds of interviews about Applied AI, conducted by several AI researchers at Intel. My responsibilities included conducting online seminars and hands-on workshops on AI and its subdomains, alongside collaborating on AI projects with peers from the Intel DevMesh community. For instance, my undergraduate institution commended me for conducting a series of online lectures on \"Using Intel's OpenVINO toolkit to optimize Deep Learning models\" for 100+ fellow students. I also conducted a session on \"Training & deploying ML models using Azure ML Studio\" as a Microsoft Student Partner. 5) Throughout my undergraduate and professional tenure, I have developed an interest and taught seminars and workshops in Artificial Intelligence, Python Programming, SQL, and Distributed Computing.\n",
      "Programming: 1) I am also proficient in SQL due to my work experience as a Data Engineer where I was responsible to optimize CI/CD pipelines for ETL processes using SQL, Python and Apache Spark. I am proficient in C++ due to my predilection for competitive coding, participation in ACM ICPC and other regional coding contests as well as my personal interest in solving problems related to Data Structures and Algorithms. I am familiar with Java & C through my undergraduate courses and projects in Object-oriented Programming, Compiler Design, etc. 2) I have used Windows OS ever since I first laid my hands on a computer, so I am quite comfortable with using PowerShell, Microsoft Office Suite, Progressive Web Apps, etc. As a programmer, I have been using the Ubuntu distribution of the Linux OS for the past 6 years. I am comfortable with using the GCC Compiler, installing and operating network surveillance or third party services like OpenMPI as well as training Machine Learning models using Kernel Optimization through the Ubuntu terminal. 3) I have implemented projects where data was managed through a variety of databases which include traditional SQL-oriented databases like Oracle DB or MS SQL as well as the modern NoSQL databases like MongoDB, Amazon DynamoDB, Couchbase DB, etc. or distributed databases like Apache HBase, Azure CosmosDB, etc.\n",
