I am also proficient in Algorithms, Data structures, and problem-solving. I have over 3 years of experience in software development in companies like Amazon and Cisco. I have worked with Tech stacks ranging from Golang, Java, C++, and Python to AWS, Ansible, and CI/CD.   I discovered a passion for teaching when I began organizing workshops for incoming undergraduates on various core computer science concepts. These experiences helped me refine my understanding and learn essential skills associated with disseminating complex information faster for beginners to learn and I have grown to love mentoring young students. I have also published articles on platforms such as GeeksForGeeks.org(https://auth.geeksforgeeks.org/user/adith%20bharadwaj/articles) and section.io(https://www.section.io/engineering-education/authors/adith-bharadwaj/), exploring various topics such as data analytics, computer networks, operating systems, and storage. While researching these domains, I was exposed to the incredible innovations in computer science and their widespread implications on society, which fortified my aspirations to pursue a career in the field.\\nProgramming: I have over 3 years of Professional experience with Java, C/C++, and DBMS including SQL, and NoSql. My primary operating systems are Linux(Ubuntu, Fedora), and macOS. I am proficient in Operating systems concepts and have professionally worked with cloud-based systems.   Having 3+ years of experience at companies like Amazon and Cisco, I have gained valuable experience in the field of software development. I have worked on building applications used by over 25 million people and with this experience I have gained skills and expertise in my field. At Amazon, I led a large-scale effort to migrate data from MySQL to DynamoDB (AWS) for a Microservice that handles user comments. My responsibilities included initial design for end-to-end migration, developing REST APIs, validating data, load testing, and implementing underlying logic for migration, which increased availability by 35% and reduced latency by 60%. During my time at Amazon, by mentoring interns and junior developers and interacting with a diverse team from various backgrounds, I recognized the importance of interpersonal/communication skills and learning to work outside my comfort zone.\\nPast Experience: CourseTitleInstructorPositionWhenINF�171Introduction to Health InformaticsRenee GarettTA2023-winterINF�121Software DesignAndre Van der HoekTA2023-spring\\nCourses Taken: CourseTitleGrWhenCS�295PKEYSTONE PROJ CSA202303CS�273PMACH LRN & DATA MINA+202303CS�261PDATA STRUCTURESA202303CS�271PARTIFICIAL INTELLIGA202292CS�253PADV PROG PROB SOLVA+202292CS�220PDATABAS & DATA MGMTB+202292\" metadata={'source': 'dummy_students_candidacy_data1.csv', 'row': 5}\n"
