I am passionate about helping students gain a solid understanding and foundation of core concepts before they move on to more challenging material. I have helped students by leading computer science labs and being a learning assistant (LA) for the following courses: Introduction to Programming (Java), Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms (Java), General Physics I: Mechanics (calculus-based), and General Physics II: Electricity and Magnetism (calculus-based). Through my work as a learning assistant over three years, I was able to aid many students in these introductory courses and am comfortable communicating base-level concepts in a way that is easy to digest. During my time as an LA, I had to lead labs during COVID. So, I led and aided lectures through Zoom for the entirety of 2020 and 2021.   My special qualifications would be coding in Java, specifically surrounding data structures and algorithms. Further, I have experience with technical writing through my computer science research and my time on my undergraduate school's Mock Trial team.   In my years as a learning assistant, I have helped aid the development of new content for the Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms course with my partner professor, participated in countless lectures to help students gain an understanding of the core computer science concepts, co-lead three-hour computer science labs to cement student understanding by implementing labs and debugging student code, took a STEM-based pedagogy course that lead to a year-long research project which culminated in a published paper at the National Physics Education Research Conference in 2022, and became the lead learning assistant for Computer Science and Physics at my undergraduate university.   I have experience in academia and the corporate world and would love to pass on the experiences and knowledge I have accumulated to others through my work as a TA. Through my REU research, I have experience researching machine learning algorithms and their utilization of big data. I also have experience with the software development cycle through my undergraduate degree in Software Engineering and my internship at McDonald's working on their payment processing. In all of these experiences, I have had to learn on the go and pick up concepts to immediately utilize them in my work. This can be transferable to my work as a TA, where I may need to brush up on foreign concepts to help aid students.

Ed. program specifically since I have goals to help design online education curriculum for Indigenous learners that is culturally responsive and culturally sustaining. I have a Bachelor's degree in Film and Television Production from USC and have worked professionally as a film editor and producer. I have taught film classes both in terms of production/technical mechanics of filmmaking and also history, aesthetics and critical theory. I am particularly well versed in Indigenous Media, Activism, and History and have guest lectured at the collegiate level several times at various universities including UCI and Dartmouth College. I have worked professionally as a video game tester, QA testing trainer, production coordinator, Assistant Producer/Project Manager for mobile games and console/PC at Activision, JAMDAT and EA. In this capacity I also engaged in collaborative game design on a professional level. I was also the sole trainer for new hires to the Quality Assurance Department for over a year. I have taught video game/application design (not programming but project visualization and management perspectives) classes in conjunction with the University of Washington while working for the Native Girls Code program as their primary instructor. I held a reader/grader position at the University of Washington for an introductory course on Educational Research Methods - I was 100% online as a RG for this course and worked primarily to support students in their research and writing. I held a Research Assistant position for the Native Education Certificate Program wherein I helped design and implement hybrid (in person and online) curriculum to facilitate training educators to provide culturally inclusive education to Indigenous learners in the state of Washington. I was a Research Assistant and Instructor for the ISTEAM (Indigenous Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, & Math) program through the University of Washington for three years. This program provided Indigenous youth with an interactive week long curriculum rooted in Indigenous methodologies for learning STEAM subject matter. I specifically worked with multi-age groups on outdoor education, digital storytelling, systems thinking and perspective taking. I authored a game design (design doc + essay format document) for my M. Ed. thesis that engages outdoor learning, embodied cognition, systems thinking, Indigenous science and storytelling, and perspective taking in a virtual environment. My focus at UW was in Indigenous culturally responsive teaching and technology in education. My focus for my Master's degree at Dartmouth is Cultural Studies and Indigenous Studies, specifically the way that media narratives (particularly those found in television, film, and video games) interact with Indigenous identities, worldviews, narratives, decolonization and activism. I was a teaching assistant for the cross listed (Education & Informatics) class Children's Learning and Media with Professor Rebecca Black. I recently did a GSR project in culturally responsive co-designed technology where I was primarily responsible as an instructor and curriculum designer for the program working with participants ages 12-22- this research was in conjunction with UCI, LISTO America and Pivotal Ventures. I have been a TA for GDIM41/ICS 60 taught by Constance Steinkuehler several times and I was also hired the month prior to the beginning of the class to help prepare the class and provide recommendations for curriculum adjustments to acknowledge and present post-colonial and decolonial perspectives. I was a TA for Geof Bowker for the course 162W Organizational Information Systems. I received very good reviews both from students and instructors for all of the courses that I have ever taught, helped design or TA'd.

With my passion for education, strong communication skills, and previous experience in assisting students, I am confident in my ability to contribute to the academic community at the University of California, Irvine.  During my Bachelor’s, I gained a solid foundation in programming languages, algorithms, and software engineering principles. Through my coursework and projects, I have developed a strong proficiency in languages such as Java, C, C++, and Python. I like to spend my free time solving questions on Leetcode. This allows me to better my understanding of Data Structures and Algorithms and also sharpen my problem-solving skills.  Link : https://leetcode.com/KiranRaghavendra/  I consider my area of proficiency to be Data Science, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Image Processing. As an engineer, I aim to utilize technology to solve real-world problems. Keeping the same in mind I conducted my undergrad research on Breast Cancer Detection and Sign Language Recognition using Deep CNNs and Graph CNNs respectively.   As part of my study on Breast Cancer Detection, I trained the Resnet50 model from scratch on the Breakhis dataset and evaluated the effects of various image processing techniques on accuracy. Findings were presented as part of the 2022 Fourth International Conference on Emerging Research in Electronics, Computer Science and Technology (ICERECT) and published in the IEEE Explore Digital Library.  Link : https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10059681  As part of the research conducted on Sign Language Recognition,  I proposed a novel technique to utilize facial key points in conjunction with skeleton key points for Sign language Recognition. This involved training the Sign Language Graph Convolutional Network(SLGCN) from scratch on the AUTSL dataset. This training included 24 key points to model facial expressions along with skeleton key points for the body. The findings have been published in the International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET) Volume 9 Issue 7.     Link : https://www.irjet.net/archives/V9/i7/IRJET-V9I7142.pdf  To better my conceptual and practical understanding of Deep CNNs, Seq2Seq RNNs, and Siamese networks, I have developed various applications utilizing the same. As part of this activity, I trained InceptionResnetV1 from scratch for face recognition and evaluated its accuracy against the same neural network used as a Siamese Network by minimizing the triplet loss function. During my undergrad, I developed a chatbot using a custom-built Seq2Seq RNN, which was trained from scratch. This was integrated with the college website, thus enabling students to ask questions and resolve queries about the college.  The times I interacted with the students and guided them with my knowledge have been extremely joyous. I discovered my passion for teaching in my undergrad, particularly in my sophomore year when we had Data Structures. My friend was finding it a little tough to grasp the concepts of trees and graphs in data structures. At the time, I asked him to create numerous folders and subfolders to store a few files and asked this question. How should I traverse the folders to open a particular file? He answered my question, and I told him the method he explained is the depth-first search algorithm. At that moment, I realized that knowing the real-life use case of a concept before diving deep into a subject will greatly improve one's understanding of the subject.  Following this, I taught various concepts to fellow students and helped them understand it better. I connected different topics in computer science with real-life use cases and used analogies while teaching concepts. I explained how friends and followers are suggested on social networking sites using graphs and how undo operation is executed using stacks. One such fun session was when I cooked instant noodles and put it in a bowl to demonstrate Dining Philosophers Problem. This enhanced my friends' understanding of the subject and made me happy, and this is how I became passionate about teaching.   After discovering my love for teaching, I served as a Machine Learning Instructor at Google Developer Student Club at JSS Science and Technology University. During my time here, I conducted numerous tutorials, hands-on courses, and technical bootcamps and provided individualized support to students. Through this role, I learned how to create an inclusive learning environment for students, while catering to diverse learning styles. Additionally, I possess excellent interpersonal skills, which enable me to build strong relationships with students and staff. I strongly believe in creating a supportive and nurturing environment that encourages students to reach their full potential.  As a Firmware Engineer in the OptiNand team at Western Digital, I maintained complete ownership of multiple features of the Opti-Nand product line. My responsibilities included software design, development, and integration of various features. This experience enhanced my problem-solving skills and gave me practical exposure to Agile Methodologies and Software Engineering Principles. During my time here, I tutored multiple interns and helped them get ramped up quickly with feature and codebase knowledge. I often found myself answering questions and clearing doubts that interns asked me. This made me realize that teaching any concept, also allows me to acquire in-depth knowledge about the same.

C is the first programming language I learned and this introduced me to the fascinating world of programming. During my sophomore year, I enrolled in the course Object Oriented Programming using Java. This allowed me to obtain a solid foundation in Object Oriented programming and I was amazed by its vast applications in our day-to-day life. To better my practical understanding I developed a Bank Application, which works on the concept of Object Oriented Programming.   Additionally, I have also taken the course Database Systems in my junior year. This introduced me to DBMS, Relational DBMS, SQL, and NoSQL. To gain a practical understanding of the same, I created a SQL integrated web application for tourist data management. This comprised two modes. Admin mode which had elevated access to view, add, and modify information, and user mode to book travel plans on the website. The website was developed with a Flask backend and the database schema was normalized to 3rd Normal Form.  Following this, I have developed various deep-learning applications in Python utilizing the Pytorch and Tensorflow(Keras) frameworks. I also have a strong proficiency in various Python libraries such as Numpy, Scikit Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas.   I have over 5 years of experience working with Windows and over 2 years of experience working with Linux distribution. I am adept at debugging common software/driver issues that arise on Windows and Linux operating systems.",,CourseTakenGradeCS 171YACS 161YACS 178NCS 122AYA
